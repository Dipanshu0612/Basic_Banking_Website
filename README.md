# Payment Gateway Integration Project.
## The Sparks Foundation
This was a task provided to me as a Web Development Intern.

### About the Project

This is a simple banking website that allows users to view and do transactions between them.\
You can see details of a particular user by clicking on that user's row.\
The details contain their Account ID, Email, Phone Number and Balance.\
This is build using React JS, Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap.\
For the backend, the database is provided by Firebase Firestore.\

### More Details

This is a responsive website. You can run it and view it on any device. 

#### Transaction Process
There are two ways you can do transaction on this system.\
Firstly you can click on one particular user and a option will appear to send money to him. The email address of that user will be filled automatically and you just have to enter the Sender's Email and Amount to do the transaction.\
The second way is the button below the table of the customers. Here you will have to enter both the Sender's and Receiver's Mail Address to do the transaction.
### Updation on the Database.
Once you make any transction, the data is sent to the Database on Firebase Firestore.\
The data is upadated if the details are correct otherwise you recieve a message saying "There was some Error".\
You will need to refresh the page to see the changes on the page.

### Important!

This project has been deployed on Netlify.\

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
